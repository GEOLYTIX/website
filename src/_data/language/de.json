Wir sind begeistert von der Auswertung und den Erkenntnissen, die GEOLYTIX geliefert hat. Unser Wissen um die Kundenbindung nach Profiltyp, Einzugsgebiete, Kannibalisierungseffekte und prognostizierte Filial-Performance stattet uns mit einer Fülle von Fakten aus, auf deren Grundlage wir Entscheidungen mit Überzeugung treffen können. Wir haben ein Vorhersage- und Kartierungstool zur Hand, das im gesamten Immobilienplanungsprozess Anwendung findet; und ein Expertenteam in Anrufweite, wenn wir einmal zusätzliche Unterstützung brauchen.","Chris Sweeney, Customer Insight Director, Wickes.":"Chris Sweeney, Customer Insight Director, Wickes.","Services":"Dienstleistungen","About":"Über uns","Blog":"Blog","Sign Up":"Registrierung","Case Study":"","'Doing' Network Strategy Better":"","Want to know more?":"Erfahren Sie mehr","Contact us":"Kontakt","Understanding breadth and depth of choice for Lottery Customers":"","Combining Art and Science":"","Improving Efficiency":"","High Street Activity Index":"","Network Planning for Franchisees":"Filialnetz-Strategie für Franchisenehmer","Property Search Portals":"","The Right Brands in the Right Locations":"","Network Planning for the Leisure Industry":"","UK Store Expansion":"","The challenge of the High Street":"","Planning for Future Success":"Planen für eine erfolgreiche Zukunft","Stay Up to Date with Geolytix":"","Privacy Policy":"","Modern Slavery":"","Awards":"","Search":"","Career":"","Census":"","COVID-19":"","Market Visits":"","Mobility":"","Open Data":"","Our Team":"","Team Thoughts":"","Welcome to the (Amazon) Jungle:":"","International Women & GEOLYTIX":"","The Geography of Pokémon GO":"","Global Retail Places":"","MAPP Q+A: Location Intelligence for Location Planning":"","Weekly Retail Recovery feeds and activity hotspot maps in MAPP":"","Playing to win: Board Game Cafés and the Communal Meeting Space":"","Geolytix Supermarket Retail Points V19":"","Australia: WFH to a COVID safe workplace.":"","Will the most walked path be the online high-street in 2021?":"","How to reinvent retail spaces for a more sustainable future?":"","MAPP shortlisted for best Business Intelligence & Analytics Solution at the Cloud Awards 2020":"","Groundhog Day":"","A 4-Month journey with Tesla: a change made on fuelling up":"","Supermarket Retail Points":"","A bit more help than just the Milkman":"","Happy New Year":"","Life After Lockdown":"","Data Analyst Role":"","Did Somebody Say…It’s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas…":"","Harnessing Mobility Data in Thailand":"","Senior Data Scientist":"","Barnsley – the future looks bright for a town with real heart and soul":"","The Wales Firebreak":"","Consistency Across Borders":"","Tiers and Tears":"","Historic England - High Street Heritage Action Zones":"","Geolytix Town & Suburb Boundaries":"","Geolytix scoop the ‘Data for Environment’ top spot at the Data IQ Awards":"","Geolytix Seamless Town & Suburb Boundaries":"","The Road to Recovery?
