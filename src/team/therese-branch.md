Therese joined the New Product Development team at Geolytix in June 2022 on a sandwich placement. She is currently on the MSc Data Science programme at Manchester Metropolitan University. 

She has four years experience in varied roles with a focus on customer relations. 

Outside of work, Therese is a sports enthusiast - preferring to spectate more than participate - and keenly follows F1 and pro-cycling. She also enjoys going to the theatre.
