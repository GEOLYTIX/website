Sam started his career as a Location Planner at Sainsbury's, spending more than 5 years supporting supermarket expansion. Over the last 9 years he has moved into software development as a Product Manager, specialising in understanding what to build customers through the use of Lean Discovery and Agile techniques.

At Geolytix Sam is able to blend both disciplines as head of the New Product Development team, while also looking to establish more Product-led ways of working across the organisation.
