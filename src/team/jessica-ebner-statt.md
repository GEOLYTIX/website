Jess is a recent Geography graduate from the University of Oxford and joined Geolytix for a six month internship in September 2023. Based in the Data team, Jess will primarily be working on initial analysis of client data, although she is looking forward to seeing all sides of the business - something she views as invaluable experience before starting a masters in Geographic Data Science next year.

Outside work, Jess enjoys reading, discovering new music, and watching (not playing!) football.
