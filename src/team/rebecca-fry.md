Rebecca studied Geography at Leeds university before going on to do a Masters in GIS. Starting her career working for an out of home media agency, she then spent nine years helping TK Maxx/HomeSense grow their European estate, before joining GEOLYTIX as a Location Planner.

Outside of work, Rebecca spends most of her time at zoos, soft play centres and farms â€“ wherever she can keep her two young children entertained. When she does have a spare hour or so Rebecca likes to read or catch up with friends over a bottle of wine.
