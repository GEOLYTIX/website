Ilya joined Geolytix in 2022 while completing his master’s thesis at the University of Leeds. Before that, he spent 4 years working for an open-data consultancy in the US, and co-authored Hands-On Data Visualisation: Interactive Storytelling from Spreadsheets to Code (published by O’Reilly). At Geolytix, Ilya’s role is to help build tools and design systems to ensure frictionless flows of data, and to improve existing and develop new data products.

In his free time, Ilya enjoys exercising, exploring tired British seaside towns, and reading books on behavioural economics.
