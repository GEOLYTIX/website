Sarah joins Geolytix as a Product Manager for MAPP, Geolytix's online market intelligence and mapping tool to help inform data-driven decisions. Sarahâ€™s background is in civil engineering, and she worked for the past seven years as a transport consultant. During this time, she used mapping and geospatial data to solve complex problems and deliver innovative solutions for clients across the globe. Sarah loves working with maps and is really excited about supporting the continued development of the MAPP product.

Outside of work, Sarah loves to travel, experience new cultures and try new food, and you will often find her taking weekend trips to various places around Europe. Having moved from Australia three years ago, she also loves exploring everything London has to offer in her spare time.
