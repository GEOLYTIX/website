Patrick started at Geolytix in 2022 as an industrial placement student. He is currently a Geography with Quantitative Methods student at the University of Leeds. The course allows him to focus on using geographical methods to analyse the relationships between societies, places and environments, emphasising quantitative approaches.  
He joins as a Data Analyst and seeks to gain an array of techniques to advance his skill set within Geolytix which will also become favourable in his final year at university to do his dissertation and other modules.
