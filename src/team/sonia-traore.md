I grew up in France and completed my Master's in Management at the French Business school ESCP Europe. I've lived in Spain and now the UK for the past 4 years. I worked for a Japanes fast-casual dining company called Marugame Udon UK for 3 years as a Growth Manager where I was overseeing the store development of the company. I have seen the business evolve from a small management team to the consecutive openings of 11 stores and the hiring of more than 400 employees in less than a year and 8 months.

I joined Geolytix in September 2023 as a Customer and Delivery partner, working closely with customers through the whole project lifecycle, making sure their location planning questions are answered and growing potential unlocked !

Always on the go, I love solo traveling and practicing different languages. I speak French, English, Spanish, and Japanese. 
I also practice Yoga weekly, and it is a big part of my life and my travel!
