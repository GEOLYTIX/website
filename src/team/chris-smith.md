Chris has over 17 years of experience across a number of fields from data processing, model building and cloud deployment. Starting his career deploying and maintaining a large internal geodata server for a large location planning team, after 7 years he then moved across to the location planning team itself to deliver models and analysis to clients across a wide range of sectors. For the last few years this was combined with product owning a cloud GIS deployment.

At Geolytix he will be heading up the engineering team to ensure our spatial models are delivered as efficiently as possible in MAPP.
