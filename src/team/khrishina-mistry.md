Khrish joined Geolytix in 2023 with almost 10 years of experience in analytics and data science, since graduating from the University of Nottingham with an MMath in Mathematics and Statistics. Her career started in location/marketing analytics at Experian, before working on personalisation at Boots, introducing data science models into the Collections department at Oakbrook Finance, and now circling back into location planning at Geolytix.

Outside of work the gym is a big part of Khrish's life, where she enjoys bodybuilding-style weight training and is a BodyAttack fitness instructor.
