Owen joined Geolytix in October 2023 as a Data Analyst. Owen is from North Wales, but at 18, moved down South to pursue BSc Geography at the University of Bristol. This undergraduate degree touched upon data analysis, but he wanted to enhance these skills and on completion of this degree, moved back up North to undertake an MSc in Urban Data Science and Analytics at the University of Leeds. 
Following this, Owen worked for a year as a Data Scientist at the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics (LIDA), working on two research projects related to population movements and Census data. 

In his spare time, Owen enjoys playing and watching most sports. He is a runner, specialising in middle-distances, which helps when chasing his springer spaniel around the fields back home!
