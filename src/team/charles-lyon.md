Charles joined Geolytix in July 2024 as a placement data analyst for a Year in Industry as part of his degree in Geography with Quantitative Methods at the University of Leeds. During his studies, Charles developed a sharp interest in urban data science and GIS so decided to focus on strengthening his skills in spatial data analysis through industry experience working on global data products.

Apart from being a geography nerd, Charles enjoys going to music gigs and festivals, travelling around the world and having a drink with his friends.
